    Knight Rider, a shadowy flight into the dangerous world of a man who does
    not exist.<br />
    Michael Knight, a young loner on a crusade to champion the cause of the
    innocent,<br />
    the helpless in a world of criminals who operate above the law.80 days
    around the world,<br />
    we’ll find a pot of gold just sitting where the rainbow’s ending. Time —
    we’ll fight against the time,<br />
    and we’ll fly on the white wings of the wind. 80 days around the world, no
    we won’t say a word before the ship is really back.<br />
    Round, round, all around the world. Round, all around the world. Round, all
    around the world. Round, all around the world.

    There’s a voice that keeps on calling me. Down the road, that’s where I’ll
    always be. Every stop I make, I make a new friend. Can’t stay for long, just
    turn around and I’m gone again. Maybe tomorrow, I’ll want to settle down,
    Until tomorrow, I’ll just keep moving on.
